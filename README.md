## What's this

This plugin is designed for Gradle build scripts. It aims to bring properties similar to those in the `gradle.properties` file into build scripts in a
type-safe way, avoiding problems that hard-coded strings might cause.

The project icon was designed by [MaiTungTM](https://github.com/Lagrio). The name comes from **G**radleP**ropify**, meaning a plugin for Gradle
properties.

It is a brand-new project rebuilt from [SweetProperty](https://github.com/HighCapable/SweetProperty), borrowing previous design ideas and making it
more polished and easier to use.

The configuration plan format of `Gropify` is similar to `SweetProperty`. If you are using `SweetProperty`, you can consider migrating to `Gropify`.
