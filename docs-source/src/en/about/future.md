# Looking Toward the Future

> The future is bright and uncertain, let us look forward to the future development potential of `Gropify`.

## Future Plans

> Features that `Gropify` may add later are included here.

### Support More Project Types

`Gropify` currently supports generating properties into the source code of Kotlin, Java, and Android projects.
In the future, it may support more projects that can participate in Gradle builds, such as C/C++ (Android JNI), Swift, etc., to meet the needs of more developers.
